[[`Toolbox Site`](https://toolbox.jonathanlawhh.com/) [`My Website`](https://jonathanlawhh.com/)]

Just a collection of tools, that I use myself. Nothing too fancy, the UI was built entirely using Google Antigravity.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash

npm run dev
```
